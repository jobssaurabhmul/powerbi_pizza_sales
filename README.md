# powerbi_sql_pizza_sales
In this project, I analyze sales of pizzas for a particular store.
The data is first analyzed in SQL. Example:

The data is also analyzed in Power BI.
A Dashboard of 2 pages has been created to visualize the analysis.

In the analysis I answer the following questions:
1. Total Revenue done by Store
2. Total Pizzas sold by the Store
3. Total Orders placed
4. Average order value
5. Average pizza sold per order
6. Trend for sales and orders by name of the day
7. Monthly sales and orders trend
8. Percentage of sales by pizza category
9. Percentage of sales by pizza size
10. Top 5 best seller pizzas by revenue
11. Bottom 5 best seller pizzas by revenue
12. Top 5 pizzas by qty sold
13. Bottom 5 pizzas by qty sold
14. The most ordered pizzas by qty and orders
15. The least ordered pizzas by qty and orders
16. Total sales during weekdays and week ends
